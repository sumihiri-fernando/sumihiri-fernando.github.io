        I have a few favorite activities that keep me energized and inspired. Coding allows me to solve complex problems and create new things, from small projects to large applications. When I'm not coding, I love traveling to explore new places, experience different cultures, and broaden my perspective on the world. In quieter moments, reading offers me a chance to dive into different stories and learn about various topics, enhancing my creativity and knowledge.
